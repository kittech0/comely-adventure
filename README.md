## About modpack
The Comely Adventure modpack is meant to be pretty difficult modpack, however with lots of adventures and beautiful world. It isn't another put all mods together modpack, the mods were choosen by hand, some really new, some old ones. It'is based on my experience of making compact but fun with a lot of features modpacks. What I mean by compact? That you wont see any duplicated features or multiple mods featuring similiar things which I have issues in many modern and big modpack. The modpack features 200+ mods all of them adding unique features.
